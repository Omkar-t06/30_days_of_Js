// Activity 5: Word Ladder

// Task 5: Solve the "Word Ladder" problem on LeetCode.
// Write a function that takes a begin word, an end word, and a dictionary of words, and finds the length of the shortest transformation sequence from the begin word to the end word, such that only one letter can be changed at a time and each transformed word must exist in the word list. Log the length of the shortest transformation sequence for a few test cases.
