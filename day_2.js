// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
let a = 10 ;

// Task 1: Write a program to add 2 no. and log the value to the console
let res = a + b;
console.log(res);

// Task 2: Write a program to substract 2 no. and log the value to the console
res = a - b;
console.log(res);

// Task 3: Write a program to multiply 2 no. and log the value to the console
res = a * b;
console.log(res);

// Task 4: Write a program to divide 2 no. and log the value to the console
res = a / b;
console.log(res);

// Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one no. is divided by another no. and log the value to the console
res = b % a;

// Activity 2: Assignment Operations
// Task 6: Use the `+=` operator to a variable and log the value to console
a += b;
console.log(a);
// Task 7: Use the `-=` operator to a variable and log the value to console
a -= b;
console.log(a);

// Activity 3: Comparison Operations
// Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using < and > log the result to the console.
console.log( a < b);
console.log( a > b);
// Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using <= and => log the result to the console.
console.log(6 <= 6);

// Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === log the result to the console.
let str1 = 'mani'

console.log(str1 == str2);
console.log(str1 === str2);

// Activity 4: Logical Operators

// Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
console.log(a > b && a < b);

// Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
console.log(a > b || a < b);

// Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.
console.log(!(a > b));
